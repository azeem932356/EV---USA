# Electric Vehicle (EV) Data Analysis

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of electric vehicle (EV) adoption, distribution, and trends, using data from various regions. The project leverages **Python** and **Seaborn** for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to generate insights on EV adoption trends, vehicle types, manufacturer popularity, and electric range.

## Project Overview
Electric vehicles are becoming increasingly popular as society shifts toward sustainable transportation solutions. This project analyzes EV data to understand key trends, including adoption over time, distribution across regions, and performance metrics. This analysis may support stakeholders in understanding EV growth patterns and areas with high EV adoption rates.

## Data
The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from [Kaggleâ€™s Electric Vehicle Population Data](https://www.kaggle.com/), containing various attributes such as model year, type, county, city, manufacturer, model, and electric range.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EV-Data-Analysis.git
   cd EV-Data-Analysis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed, then install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook or script:**
   Open the `EV_Data_Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook, or run the `.py` script.

## Code Explanation

### Data Loading and Cleaning
- Load the dataset using `pandas` and examine its structure and any null values.
- Drop rows with missing values to ensure data quality for analysis.

### EV Adoption Over Time
- **Objective:** Analyze EV adoption by model year.
- **Code:** Counts and visualizes vehicles by model year to show growth trends over time.
  
### Electric Vehicle Type Distribution
- **Objective:** Understand the distribution of different EV types.
- **Code:** Plots the distribution of vehicle types to identify popular categories.

### Top Counties and Cities by EV Registrations
- **Objective:** Identify top counties and cities with the highest EV registrations.
- **Code:** Filters the data for the top three counties and analyzes city-level data within those counties, highlighting the top cities by EV adoption.

### Popular EV Manufacturers
- **Objective:** Determine the top EV manufacturers by the number of vehicles registered.
- **Code:** Visualizes the top 10 manufacturers to identify leading brands in the EV market.

### Top EV Models
- **Objective:** Discover the most popular EV models within the top manufacturers.
- **Code:** Visualizes the top 10 models across the most popular manufacturers.

### Electric Vehicle Range Distribution
- **Objective:** Analyze the range of electric vehicles.
- **Code:** Plots a histogram of electric range (in miles) to show the distribution and density of EV range.

### Top Models by Average Electric Range
- **Objective:** Identify models with the highest average electric range.
- **Code:** Calculates and visualizes the top 10 models by average electric range to highlight long-range options.
